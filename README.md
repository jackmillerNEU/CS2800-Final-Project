# CS2800-Final-Project

Final Project

Directories in the following files will have to be adjusted in order to work:
~/build-a-board.py
~/positional-games-qbf-encoding/run_encoder.sh


Use build-a-board.py to create a .pg file which contains the game board in the format required for the positional game encoder

Use run_encoder.sh to output the qdimacs files to the depqbf folder

Use ./depqbf (optional tag --qdo) input.qdimacs to run qbf solver
